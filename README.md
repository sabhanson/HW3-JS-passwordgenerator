# HW3-JS-passwordgenerator


## Description

My motivation to build this website is so users can receive a unique password to use on their various web accounts.

I built this site to function as a random password generator based on user inputs for length and type of characters to include.

This website solves the problem of having to think of random passwords. The functions in play on this website will generate a unique password every time based on your choices.

I learned a lot about javaScript, specifically how to use while and for loops. I also learned how to use the concat feature to assign various constants into one array. I struggled initially with making the code simple and easy to understand. I overcomplicated it at first and struggled to find answers. I worked with a few of my peers to troubleshoot issues I was having and further my understanding.

## Usage 

User needs to first load the page. Then, user needs to click "Generate Password" to bring up the window. User must answer first prompt with a valid number between 8 and 128. User then must answer questions about whether or not they want to include: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols, and/or numbers. After all prompts are properly answered, a unique password will populate in the box where it previously said "Your Secure Password".
